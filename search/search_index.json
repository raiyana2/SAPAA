Stewards submit observations via Google Forms, Admin converts them in MS Excel, and the results are stored in a local MS Access database. This project replaces that temporary setup with a sustainable, low-cost cloud data infrastructure that automatically ingests inspection data into a PostgreSQL database, enables Admin to manage the data and generate PDF reports. A major focus of our implementation is scalable and cost-aware image management. Inspection images are stored in AWS S3, providing a reliable, secure, and affordable solution for handling large volumes of media. The primary user is the Admin, who needs a reliable, maintainable system that eliminates manual data handling, while keeping his access to the data as well as report generation and distribution. This project also hopes to create Android and iOS versions of the web application for stewards to bring out into the field and be able to log their observations while offline.</p>"},{"location":"#project-glossary","title":"Project glossary","text":"<ul> <li> <p>SAPAA: Stewards of Alberta\u2019s Protected Areas Association.

</p> <ul> <li>Stewards can view all sites, read inspection details, search and sort data, and generate reports (mobile app).  </li> <li>Admins have all steward features plus access to the Admin Dashboard (statistics, heatmap) and Account Management (create/edit/delete users).  </li> </ul> <p>Q2: What does \"Needs Attention\" mean? </p> <p>A: A site is flagged \"Needs Attention\" (or \"Needs Review\") when it hasn't been inspected for approximately 2 years or more. This signals to coordinators that the site may need a new visit.</p> <p>Q3: Why do some sites say \"No inspection date\"? </p> <p>A: This means no inspection date has been recorded in the database for that site. Possible reasons:</p> <ul> <li>It's a newly added site</li> <li>It's an older record without a date</li> <li>Inspections were conducted but dates weren't entered</li> </ul> <p>Q4: What is the Naturalness Score? </p> <p>A: The Naturalness Score is an average value (1.0 to 4.0) summarizing how natural or disturbed a site is based on inspection reports:</p> <ul> <li>4.0 = Excellent: Pristine, natural condition</li> <li>3.0 = Good: Mostly natural, minor disturbances</li> <li>2.0 = Fair: Some disturbance</li> <li>1.0 = Poor: Highly disturbed</li> </ul> <p>Higher values indicate better natural conditions.</p> <p>Q5: Can I change my own password? </p> <p>A: This depends on your deployment configuration. If you don't see a \"Change Password\" or \"Reset Password\" option in the app or web interface, contact your SAPAA administrator for assistance.</p> <p>Q6: How do I download sites for offline use? </p> <p>A: (Mobile app only)</p> <ol> <li>Go to the Sites tab while online</li> <li>Tap the checkbox next to sites you want to download</li> <li>Tap \"Download\"</li> <li>Sites are now available offline</li> </ol> <p>Q7: Why doesn't a site show up on the heatmap? </p> <p>A: Possible reasons:</p> <ul> <li>The site name didn't match your search keyword</li> <li>The site couldn't be geocoded (no coordinates found)</li> <li>Temporary issue with the geocoding service</li> </ul> <p>Try a different keyword or contact an admin.</p> <p>Q8: How often should I sync the mobile app? </p> <p>A: It depends on your workflow:</p> <ul> <li>Daily field use: Sync daily or before heading out</li> <li>Occasional use: Sync weekly or before important meetings</li> <li>After major updates: Sync immediately if you know new data was added</li> </ul> <p>Q9: Can I use the mobile app without internet? </p> <p>A: Yes, but with limitations:</p> <ul> <li>You must download sites while online first</li> <li>Only downloaded sites are available offline</li> <li>You can view details, read inspections, and generate reports</li> <li>You cannot sync new data or access the map</li> </ul> <p>Q10: Who do I contact if I have a problem? </p> <p>A: Contact your SAPAA program coordinator or system administrator using the contact information provided by your organization.</p> <p>Q11: How do I know which version of the app I'm using? </p> <p>A: (Mobile app)</p> <ul> <li>Go to device Settings \u2192 Apps \u2192 SAPAA</li> <li>The version number is listed there</li> </ul> <p>Q12: Can I access SAPAA from a tablet? </p> <p>A:</p> <ul> <li>Mobile app: Yes, if you have an Android or iOS tablet</li> <li>Web app: Yes, any device with a modern web browser can access it</li> </ul> <p>Q13: What happens if I lose internet connection while using the web app? </p> <p>A: You'll see error messages when trying to load data.
