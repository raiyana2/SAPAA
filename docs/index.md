# Project Requirements


## Executive summary

SAPAA currently manages site inspection data through a manual pipeline. Stewards submit observations via Google Forms, Admin converts them in MS Excel, and the results are stored in a local MS Access database. This project replaces that temporary setup with a sustainable, low-cost cloud data infrastructure that automatically ingests inspection data into a PostgreSQL database, enables Admin to manage the data and generate PDF reports. A major focus of our implementation is scalable and cost-aware image management. Inspection images are stored in AWS S3, providing a reliable, secure, and affordable solution for handling large volumes of media. The primary user is the Admin, who needs a reliable, maintainable system that eliminates manual data handling, while keeping his access to the data as well as report generation and distribution. This project also hopes to create Android and iOS versions of the web application for stewards to bring out into the field and be able to log their observations while offline.

> 2. Users can change font size by selecting one of the other options
> 3. When an option is selected the text on screen will change size to match the selected option
> 4. UI and information should be legible and responsive regardless of font size
> 5. If a user selects the font size they are already using, nothing should change

## MoSCoW

The **MoSCoW method** is used to prioritize user stories based on their criticality and impact.  
Each user story is categorized into one of the following priority levels:

- **Must-have**  
  Essential requirements that are critical for the application to function.

- **Should-have**  
  Important features that are not strictly essential but add significant value.

- **Could-have**  
  Desirable features that enhance the application but are not required for core functionality.

- **Would Like But Won’t Get**  
  Features that are out of scope for the current project or deferred for future consideration.

## Open-source Projects
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
    - **What it is:** Open-source backend (managed Postgres + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions).
    - **How we’ll use it (external interface):**  
      - PostgreSQL as the **system of record** for inspections/sites.  
      - Storage for **images** and generated **PDF reports**.  
      - Auth + **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to separate Admin vs Reader access.  
      - **Edge Functions / cron** to build nightly **offline data bundles** (JSON + thumbnails + PDFs).
    - **Reference/inspiration:** Supabase’s PostgREST and RLS patterns for secure CRUD without a custom API layer.
    - **Source of insights:** Example implementations for file storage policies and signed URLs.
    - **Risks/notes:** Free-tier and pricing limits can change; large media can impact storage/egress. We’ll set a monthly budget cap in the Project Plan and monitor usage.

* [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/)
    - **What it is:** Open-source alternative to survey platforms like Google Forms
    - **How we’ll use it (external interface):**

## Cloud Services & Infrastructure
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
    - **What it is:** Object storage service for scalable and cost-effective file storage.
    - **How we’ll use it (external interface):**  
      - Store all uploaded site inspection images.  
      - Serve images via signed URLs for secure, time-limited access.  
      - Separate media storage from the core database to reduce costs.
    - **Reference/inspiration:** Standard architecture pattern for media-heavy applications.
    - **Source of insights:** AWS S3 best practices for IAM policies, bucket privacy, and lifecycle rules.
    - **Risks/notes:** Misconfigured permissions can expose data; billing alerts and access policies will be enforced.
