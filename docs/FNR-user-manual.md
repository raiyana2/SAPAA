### Understanding Naturalness Scores

**What is a Naturalness Score?**

The Naturalness Score is an average value (typically 1.0 to 4.0) that summarizes how natural or disturbed a site is based on inspection reports.

**Score Ranges:**

- **1.0 – Poor**: Highly disturbed, significant human impact
- **2.0 – Fair**: Some disturbance, but still functional
- **3.0 – Good**: Mostly natural with minor disturbances
- **4.0 – Excellent**: Pristine, natural condition

**How It's Calculated:**

- Each inspection includes a naturalness rating
- The score shown is the average of all inspections
- "N/A" means no scores have been recorded

**Why It Matters:**

- Helps identify sites that may need restoration or management
- Tracks whether site condition is improving or declining over time
- Guides resource allocation for conservation efforts

**Where to Find It:**

- If the map appears but is empty: geocoding may have failed for those sites

---

### Problem: I Don't See the "Admin" Button

**Solution:**

- Ask an existing admin to check your role
- Go to **Account Management** (if you have another admin account)

5. Download them again (this gets the latest data)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1: What's the difference between a steward and an admin?**  

**A:**  

- **Stewards** can view all sites, read inspection details, search and sort data, and generate reports (mobile app).  
- **Admins** have all steward features plus access to the **Admin Dashboard** (statistics, heatmap) and **Account Management** (create/edit/delete users).  

---

**Q2: What does "Needs Attention" mean?**  

**A:** A site is flagged **"Needs Attention"** (or **"Needs Review"**) when it hasn't been inspected for approximately **2 years or more**. This signals to coordinators that the site may need a new visit.

---

**Q3: Why do some sites say "No inspection date"?**  

**A:** This means no inspection date has been recorded in the database for that site. Possible reasons:

- It's a newly added site
- It's an older record without a date
- Inspections were conducted but dates weren't entered

---

**Q4: What is the Naturalness Score?**  

**A:** The **Naturalness Score** is an average value (**1.0 to 4.0**) summarizing how natural or disturbed a site is based on inspection reports:

- **4.0 = Excellent**: Pristine, natural condition
- **3.0 = Good**: Mostly natural, minor disturbances
- **2.0 = Fair**: Some disturbance
- **1.0 = Poor**: Highly disturbed

Higher values indicate better natural conditions.

---

**Q5: Can I change my own password?**  

**A:** This depends on your deployment configuration. If you don't see a **"Change Password"** or **"Reset Password"** option in the app or web interface, contact your SAPAA administrator for assistance.

---

**Q6: How do I download sites for offline use?**  

**A:** *(Mobile app only)*

1. Go to the **Sites** tab while online
2. Tap the checkbox next to sites you want to download
3. Tap **"Download"**
4. Sites are now available offline

---

**Q7: Why doesn't a site show up on the heatmap?**  

**A:** Possible reasons:

- The site name didn't match your search keyword
- The site couldn't be geocoded (no coordinates found)
- Temporary issue with the geocoding service

Try a different keyword or contact an admin.
